Power up board, measure voltages on power header.
Toggling the power switch should enable/disable the VCC rail, it did not - the on/off circuitry must be faulty in some way.
By inspection, it was found that the footprint of the mosfets Q1,Q2 and Q3 were wrong.
Rotating the component fixed the issue and Vcc and subsequently 2v5 toggles correctly.

Upon turning the board on VCCIO seems to go directly to 3.3V, but discharges slowly.
The enable signal is low, indicating that the output from the comparator is wrong.
The inputs to the comparator were swapped to fix the issue.

The output voltage on VCCIO is 3.4V due to R4 being 47k rather than 45.3k, paralleling this with a 1.5M resistor gave 3.33 V instead.

Due to mechanical bouncing in the power switch, the power off sequence is messy. (see the data)
This could possibly be solved using a low-pass filter and maybe a schmitt-trigger circuit.
