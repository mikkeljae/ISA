\subsection{Carrier Card Design}
\label{sub:carrier_design}

\subsubsection*{Power Requirements}
\label{sub:power_req}
A carrier card  needs to provide the following voltages for the MicroZed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V_{in} = 5V$
	\item $V_{ccio,13}$ (Voltage logic level for I/O bank 13)
	\item $V_{ccio,34}$ (Voltage logic level for I/O bank 34)
	\item $V_{ccio,35}$ (Voltage logic level for I/O bank 35)
\end{itemize}
The different I/0 banks can be operated at different voltage levels.
According to \cite{zynq_dc}, the possibly logic levels for I/O banks are 1.2V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, and 3.3V 

It was chosen to supply all I/O banks with a voltage level of 3.3V as there were no need for multiple different levels and 3.3V is widely used.

$$ V_{ccio} =  V_{ccio,13} = V_{ccio,34} = V_{ccio,35} = 3.3V$$

\subsubsection*{Power Up Sequencing}
On power up the first that needs to happen is to pull the MicroZeds PWR\_EN high on the carrier card.
This is done with a pull-up resistor as shown in figure \ref{fig:pwr_en_circuit}.

	\caption{Circuit for proper power sequencing on MicroZeds PWR\_EN.}
	\label{fig:pwr_en_circuit}
\end{figure}

When the MicroZed has powered up its internal DC/DC converters and is ready to receive voltage on its I/O banks the VCCIO\_EN will go high.
VCCIO\_EN has a logic level of 1.8V and the signal is therefore fed to a comparator that outputs a 5V signal to a DC/DC converter when VCCIO\_EN is high.
The DC/DC converter is configured to produce a voltage level of 3.3V that is connected to $V_{ccio}$
This circuitry can be seen in figure \ref{fig:pwr_io_circuit}.

	\label{fig:pwr_io_circuit}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Power Down Sequencing}
On power down VCCIO\_EN, DCDC\_EN and PWR\_EN should be pulled down. 
VCCIO\_EN needs to be pulled down first, hereafter PWR\_EN and lastly DCDC\_EN .
The signals are pulled down by MOSFETS controlled by the V\_OFF signal.
When the power switch on the carrier card is flicked, the battery voltage is connected to the V\_OFF rail thereby turning the MOSFETS on and pulling the signals down. 
The correct sequence is maintained by charging capacitors on the gate side of the MOSFETS thereby creating a delay.
Such a MOSFET circuit is shown in figure \ref{fig:pwr_en_circuit}.
